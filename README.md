# gitBrowser

This is an iOS app for browsing github. 
I created it using pluralsight as a resource as a project designed 
to teach myself how to create react-native applications. 

## to run locally
run the following commands to run this app in xcode (with xcode installed)


```
npm install
open GithubBrowser.xcodeproj // now press the run button in xcode
```
